             <p>Minecraft is played on unique worlds generated by the game. These worlds imtiate the conditions and mechanics of the real world, they have biomes, weather and gravity.</p>
                <p>Also the worlds have three dimensions, 
                  <ul> <li>The Overwolrd: where a player spawns,</li>
                    <li> The Nether: a beautiful, scary fiery place</li> 
                    <li>The End: the dimension where  the game's final boss resides</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
            <p>Minecraft as the name entails involves mining and crafting. A player generates a blocky world and manipulates it.
The player isn't the only entity in the world there are villagers, animals, magical creatuers, monsters and different bosses to deal with.</p>   
           <p>Additionaly you can choose to have your own world or to play  with friends. Mincraft is both single and multplayer friendly. It also enables crossplatform gaming. Minecraft's "better together" motif also give players the options of playing in large numbers via player owned realms and servers. The game  has surported independent minigame servers that have thousands of players on at  any time.</p>
          <p>The game has two core modes of game play:Survival mode and Creative mode

        <section class="main-section" id="Creative_mode" >
          <header>Creative mode</header>
           <article>
            <p>This gives the player complete control of the world. You have acess to all items in the game, can use commands to create things and summon creatures,control the weather,etc!</p>
            <p> When in creative mode a player is invulnerable,can fly, can summon objects only obtainble by commands, its the perfered game mode of players who are builders and redstone enigineers.</p>
            <p>
              some common minecraft commands include:
              <ul> 
                <li><code>/locate</code> to find a biome or specific structure.</li>
              <li> <code>/Time set</code> to set time in your world.</li>
               <li> <code>/setspawn</code> to set a spawnpoint.
               <li>  <code>/teleport @ </code> to teleport to a specified location</li>
                <li>  <code>/tell</code> to privately message another player.</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Survival_mode">
        <header>Survival mode</header>
         <article>
           <p>The other variations of survival are:
             <ul>
             <li>Peaceful:No mostile mobs, Hunger doesnt deplete and health replenishes overtime.</li>
             <li>Easy: Hostile mobs spawn but deal less damage. hunger bar depletes and drains health to 5 hearts.</li>
             <li>Normal: Hostile mobs, Standard damage and hunger bar depletes health to haf a heart.</li>
<li>Hard:Hostile mobs deal more damage, hunger bar depletes and drains all health, zombies can break down doors</li>
<li>Hardcore: (only available on Java editon) Hard diffculty with the additon that a player cannot respawn after death, you die thats it. </li>
             </ul>
           </p>
          <p>In this game mode you are mortal, have limted inventory and have to work for everything you'll have.</p>
          <p>A player spawns in a random location in the generated world. You begin with nothing unless you enable the 'starter chest' option in the setttings.</p>
      <p>To get things done you have to break blocks, mine and craft, and fight monsters to stand a chance and move up in the world. Nights are deadly, caves are deadly, the ocean isn't safe, its a lot of fun!</p>
          <p>You have to survive, thrive and deal with monsters, raids, dangerous wheather, different dimensions, fall damage and creepers (the minecraft mascot) </p>
        <p>This is the game mode in whcih you can beat the game. To do this you have to gather certain materials in the Overworld and The Nether to get to the End - a dimension- where you have to defeat the enderdragon to beat the game.</p>
        <p>Survival mode also has achiviments a player can earn and complete. Doing so is also viewed as completion of the game.</p>
        <p>After beating the game there's plenty of other things you can do in your world to keep you entrtained for a long time. </p>
